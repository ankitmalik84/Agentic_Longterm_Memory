# üß† Agentic Chatbot v3 ‚Äî With Long-Term Semantic Memory

This third version builds on the agentic design of v2, but adds a powerful new layer:  
**vector database integration** for semantic memory.

With this, the chatbot becomes more context-aware, capable of retrieving relevant past conversations even if the wording is different.  
It simulates long-term memory, something that wasn't possible in the earlier versions.

## üîç Core Functionalities

### 1. üß± Initialization

As before, the chatbot loads all the foundational components:
- OpenAI client
- Configurations
- Session ID
- SQL-based managers

But now it adds:
- **`VectorDBManager`** ‚Äî connects to a vector database (e.g., Chroma) for storing and retrieving embeddings of past conversations.

It also updates the list of tools (functions the agent can call) to include:
- `add_user_info_to_database`
- `search_vector_db` (replacing `search_chat_history` from v2)

### 2. ‚öôÔ∏è Function Execution

The chatbot supports OpenAI function calling.  
Now, when the model asks to search memory, it can do so **semantically** using vector similarity rather than keyword matching.

This leads to more relevant, nuanced, and context-aware behavior.

---

### 3. üîÅ Conversational Loop

Same looping architecture as v2:
- The chatbot keeps prompting the model until a final response is ready
- It handles tool calls, updates chat history, and builds a dynamic system prompt using:
  - User info
  - Chat summary
  - Chat history
  - Function call results
  - And now: vector memory!

The system prompt uses a new builder:  
`prepare_system_prompt_for_agentic_chatbot_v2` ‚Äî designed to support semantic memory and vector search results.

### 4. üß† Vector Memory Update

After every conversation:

```python
msg_pair = f"user: {user_message}, assistant: {assistant_response}"
self.vector_db_manager.update_vector_db(msg_pair)
```
This message pair is embedded and stored in the vector database.

That means the next time the user asks a related question, the chatbot can recall this past exchange even if it's phrased differently.

| **Search Capability** | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Keyword/phrase-based search on SQL database (not semantic) | ‚úÖ Semantic search using vector embeddings (stored in a vector database) |
| **Prompt Strategy** | Simple prompt | Prompt with function call context | Prompt with function call context
| **Fallback Strategy** | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Includes a fallback mechanism| ‚úÖ Includes a fallback mechanism|
| **Memory System** | Chat history + summary | Chat history + summary + **SQL db search result** | Chat hirsoty + summary + **long-term memory (vector DB)** |
| **System Prompt** | `prepare_system_prompt` | `prepare_system_prompt_for_agentic_chatbot_v1` | `...v2` with vector support context |
| **Knowledge Retention** | Temporary, short-term | Contextually limited | **Semantically indexed for long-term reasoning** |

## üß† Final Thoughts

This chatbot represents a **hybrid agent** ‚Äî blending dynamic tool use with smart, long-term memory.

It:
- Understands conversations across sessions
- Grows more intelligent over time
- Uses semantic reasoning to bring relevant context into its responses

This is the blueprint for building **truly intelligent assistants** ‚Äî not just reactive models, but adaptive agents.
